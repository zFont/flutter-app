# zFont

**zFont** in Flutter

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

If this is your first Flutter project, here are a few resources to help you get started:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For additional help with Flutter development, check out the [online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which includes tutorials, samples, mobile development guidance, and a comprehensive API reference.

## Known Issues

I use Google Blogger to host thumbnail and preview images, but it encounters CORS errors on the web platform. To bypass these CORS errors, I created a Cloudflare Worker to act as a proxy. Check the [image-proxy](image-proxy) directory for the source code of the image proxy.
